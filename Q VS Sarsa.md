The performance of SARSA versus Q-learning can depend on various factors including the specific environment, the nature of the task, and the exploration-exploitation strategy. Here are some key differences between SARSA and Q-learning that can influence their performance:

    Exploration Strategy:
        SARSA (on-policy): Learns the value of the policy being followed, which includes the exploration steps. It tends to be more conservative because it updates the Q-values based on the actual actions taken, including exploratory actions.
        Q-learning (off-policy): Learns the value of the optimal policy independently of the actions taken. It tends to be more aggressive because it updates the Q-values assuming the best possible actions will be taken in the future.

    Stability and Robustness:
        SARSA: Can be more stable and robust in environments where exploration is risky, as it accounts for the exploratory actions taken.
        Q-learning: Can be more effective in environments where finding the optimal policy quickly is important and exploration is less risky.

    Performance in Different Scenarios:
        Stochastic Environments: SARSA may perform better in stochastic environments because it takes into account the actual actions and their consequences, including the variability in the environment.
        Deterministic Environments: Q-learning may perform better in deterministic environments where it can quickly converge to the optimal policy by aggressively exploiting the learned Q-values.

Experimentation to Compare Performance

To determine which algorithm performs better in your specific scenario, you can conduct experiments by running both algorithms under the same conditions and comparing their performance. Hereâ€™s an outline of how you can do this:

    Define Performance Metrics: Common metrics include cumulative rewards, the number of steps to reach the goal, and convergence time.

    Run Experiments: Implement both SARSA and Q-learning in the same environment and run them for a sufficient number of episodes.

    Analyze Results: Compare the performance metrics to see which algorithm performs better.

Below is a simple comparison script where both SARSA and Q-learning are run in the same environment:
